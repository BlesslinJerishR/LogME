"You know, master classes are essentially extended Q&As. That's how I always approach them. I don't mean to downplay it. It's just that I never fancy myself as someone who is taking a class. 'Master class' insinuates a teacher, and I'm not one." : "Sean Baker",

There was no place to hide." : "Robert Reich",

"My high-school a cappella teacher would embarrass me in front of the choir. 'Mavis, you're in the basement. Mavis, you're singing with the boys.' I said, 'Mr. Finch, my voice isn't soprano. I can't sing up there with the girls.' So I just got out of the choir." : "Mavis Staples",

"I had always been fascinated with Napoleon because he was a self-made emperor; Victor Hugo said, 'Napoleon's will to power,' and it was the title of my paper. And I submitted it to my teacher, and he didn't think I had written it. And he wanted me to explain it to him." : "August Wilson",

"I know it affected me when I saw certain actors growing up. I had a drama teacher that would take us to see plays in New York, and it was seeing James Earl Jones and Raul Julia - I mean, this guy comes from the place my mother comes from.

Adams",

"I was never one to go up to someone as a five- or six-year-old and say, 'Hello, my name's Paul, will you be my friend?'

"I was very fortunate that a teacher saw that I read a lot and got bored very easily and had a lot of energy, so she said, 'You've got to go to this youth theater.'

"My brother was the first to be home-schooled, and one reason they home-schooled me was so he wouldn't get jealous. Another thing is my mom noticed that I would stress out a lot about school. I would ask my teacher how good my grades were and think about that all the time." : "Rich Brian",

"I took a couple of classes in clowning, but that was more like Lucille Ball kind of slapstick, not Ringling Brothers.

Never a name." : "June Diane Raphael",
"Throughout my childhood, I did a form of Irish dancing that was kind of the precursor to 'Riverdance.'

"I think that I had read so much fiction that the craft itself sort of sank into me. I didn't read any 'how to' books or attend any popular-fiction-writing classes or have a critique group. For many years into my writing, I didn't even know another author. For me, a lot of reading was the best teacher." : "Ann Maxwell",

"In the case of my book, I don't think it's really the coming-out gay novel that everyone really needed, even though it was received as such. The boy is too creepy, he betrays his teacher, the only adult man with whom he's enjoyed a sexual experience, etc." : "Edmund White",
"I joined the police force with one motivation in mind: to become a high school PE teacher.

"China's republican politics is like a child who just started schooling. He must have a good teacher and be surrounded by good friends.

"If you have a dream, give it a chance to happen." : "Richard M. DeVos",
"I always believe a woman should have 5 non-negotiables that she should stick to when attracting a mate.

"Socialism violates at least three of the Ten Commandments: It turns government into God, it legalizes thievery and it elevates covetousness.

"Money can't buy you happiness, but it helps you look for it in a lot more places." : "Milton Berle",

"At one point, I recognized that Warren Buffett, though he had every advantage in learning from Ben Graham, did not copy Ben Graham but, rather, set out on his own path and ran money his way, by his own rules...

"I spent three days a week for 10 years educating myself in the public library, and it's better than college. People should educate themselves - you can get a complete education for no money.

"It is easy to be independent when you've got money. But to be independent when you haven't got a thing, that's the Lord's test." : "Mahalia Jackson",

"Right from my childhood, I have believed in a Supreme Power. I don't know whether it has form, or it is formless. I am a high school dropout. How come life has given me so much?

I was a governor during the 9/11 attack." : "Jim Gilmore",
"Truth knows no color; it appeals to intelligence." : "James Hal Cone",

"People have taught me not to look for intelligence in rockmusic." : "Andrew Eldritch",

"It is only when you watch the dense mass of thousands of ants, crowded together around the Hill, blackening the ground, that you begin to see the whole beast, and now you observe it thinking, planning, calculating. It is an intelligence, a kind of live computer, with crawling bits for its wits." : "Lewis Thomas",
"Bottom line is, I didn't return to Apple to make a fortune. I've been very lucky in my life and already have one. When I was 25, my net worth was $100 million or so.

"When people are in the thrall of poisonous ideology, it's really not all about deliberate ill will, or inherent hatred, or a lack of intelligence.

"When our governments want to sell us a course of action, they do it by making sure it's the only thing on the agenda, the only thing everyone's talking about.

"There is no worse screen to block out the Spirit than confidence in our own intelligence." : "John Calvin",

"My mom was a teacher - I have the greatest respect for the profession - we need great teachers - not poor or mediocre ones." : "Condoleezza Rice",

"I was a teacher once." : "Nita Ambani",
"I was voted Most Likely to Make a Teacher Retire." : "Russ",
"I've always remembered something Sanford Meisner, my acting teacher, told us. When you create a character, it's like making a chair, except instead of making someting out of wood, you make it out of yourself. That's the actor's craft - using yourself to create a character." : "Robert Duvall",

Stories like that stay with you forever." : "Marie Lu",
"We all go back to our roots. My father went to the central west, went to Ilfracombe in 1919. He was the manager of the wool scour there. And, Ilfracombe was right at the heart of Australia's great wool industry, and my mother was a teacher at Winton." : "Quentin Bryce",
"I don't know anybody who said, 'I love that teacher, he or she gave a really good homework set,' or 'Boy, that was the best class I ever took because those exams were awesome.'

I'm so blessed that God has chosen me to do that." : "El DeBarge",
"After leaving school, I travelled around Europe for about six months. In Denmark, I thought that was my chance to get an amazing haircut, so I went to what I thought was a great hairdresser.

"My dad's American, and my mom's French. I lived in France for the first 18 years of my life, then came here to go to school at the College of William and Mary. I studied marketing.

"I hate the unfairness of injustice. Anybody who thinks they are better than others or 'chosen' or feel they have an entitlement... be it through monarchy, government or money. I think we are all born the same. We are entitled to an equal shot at life." : "Liam Cunningham",
"We all need money, but there are degrees of desperation." : "Anthony Burgess",

"The money in politics is a cash cow for the media." : "Noam Chomsky",
"I hope to be like Bill Gates, bro. With all the money in the world." : "Young Thug",
"For my money, Tony Bennett is the best singer in the business. He excites me when I watch him. He moves me. He's the singer who gets across what the composer has in mind, and probably a little more." : "Frank Sinatra",
"We set up a small bitcoin and ethereum mining operation... that miraculously now is actually making a lot of money." : "Abigail Johnson",
"For me, money is not my definition of success. Inspiring people is a definition of success." : "Kanye West",
"Whenever I'm trying to decide how to spend my precious time, energy, or money, I ask myself a series of questions. 'Will this broaden or deepen my relationships?'

"Money has no utility to me beyond a certain point." : "Bill Gates",
"There is no virtue in compulsory government charity, and there is no virtue in advocating it.

J. O'Rourke",
"Money motivates neither the best people, nor the best in people. It can move the body and influence the mind, but it cannot touch the heart or move the spirit; that is reserved for belief, principle, and morality." : "Dee Hock",
"Money plays an important role in football, but it is not the dominating factor. When Chelsea play a Carling Cup game in a small city, and it could result in a draw - the excitement, the spirit, the atmosphere - that's the real beauty of football in England." : "Roman Abramovich",
"I will never win an Oscar, and do you know why? First of all, because I'm not Jewish. Secondly, I make too much money for all those old farts in the Academy." : "Clint Eastwood",

"Innovation has nothing to do with how many R & D dollars you have. When Apple came up with the Mac, IBM was spending at least 100 times more on R & D. It's not about money. It's about the people you have, how you're led, and how much you get it." : "Steve Jobs",
"I was rich before I had any money. Being rich has nothing to do with anything monetary." : "CM Punk",
"On the Left, the best and brightest go into politics - Barack Obama is the epitome of the perfect leftist. On the Right, the best and brightest go make money. Very few conservatives want to endure all the nonsense you have to put up with to run for office." : "Ted Cruz",
"Divorce is expensive. I used to joke they were going to call it 'all the money,' but they changed it to 'alimony.' It's ripping your heart out through your wallet." : "Robin Williams",

Everything amazes us, and we think anything is possible. We continuously experience life with a sense of newness and unbridled curiosity." : "Yehuda Berg",

"I'm a little lavish I must admit. But I'm not really concerned with money. Being rich is not my goal, being wealthy is." : "CeeLo Green",
"When I first started fighting, it wasn't the easiest thing. I didn't have all the money in the world. I was eating Subway once in a while, some packets of oatmeal here and there. It wasn't that bad, but it's because I was fortunate and had good people there to support me." : "Tony Ferguson",

"We live in a fantasy world, a world of illusion. The great task in life is to find reality." : "Iris Murdoch",

"My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style." : "Maya Angelou",
"Life is about choices. Some we regret, some were proud of. Some will haunt us forever. 'Black Rain' was very much about choices. The message - we are what we chose to be." : "Graham Brown",
"Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend." : "Melody Beattie",

"Love is our true destiny. We do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone - we find it with another." : "Thomas Merton",

"By the time we get to the 2040s, we'll be able to multiply human intelligence a billionfold. That will be a profound change that's singular in nature.

"Humanity I love you because when you're hard up you pawn your intelligence to buy a drink." : "e. e. cummings",
"After all, it is the divinity within that makes the divinity without; and I have been more fascinated by a woman of talent and intelligence, though deficient in personal charms, than I have been by the most regular beauty." : "Washington Irving",
"And I think the greatest danger that AI poses isn't so much these anthropomorphic beings who look like us and are beguiling are going to fool us. It's the fact that a intelligence without a body or corporeal form will fool us into trusting it with data, which we seem to think is... it has no repercussions." : "Lisa Joy",
"I've never loved a character as much as I do Niska. The way she's been written is so complex, with huge amounts of light and dark. It's a really satisfying challenge to play someone who is superhuman in their intelligence and physical ability but completely naive when it comes to certain aspects of life." : "Emily Berrington",
"The fact is that a car used by Gerry Adams and myself during the course of the Mitchell review was bugged by elements within British military intelligence." : "Martin McGuinness",
"Being a unique superpower undermines the military intelligence of strategy. To think strategically, one has to imagine oneself in the enemy's place. If one cannot do this, it is impossible to foresee, to take by surprise, to outflank. Misinterpreting an enemy can lead to defeat. This is how empires fall." : "John Berger",
"It is not difficult for me to have this faith, for it is incontrovertible that where there is a plan there is intelligence - an orderly, unfolding universe testifies to the truth of the most majestic statement ever uttered - 'In the beginning, God.'" : "Arthur Compton",

"From the lowest animals of which we can affirm intelligence up to man this type of intellect is found." : "Edward Thorndike",
"It's hard to say how far we are down the road to our conventional understanding of artificial intelligence, but I think what we've developed so far, if it's not already consciously awake and hiding from us because it's seen what an ugly and destructive race we are, and it's trying to preserve itself, it's probably in a state of dreaming." : "Jack Reynor",
"In Spain, we should have enough intelligence, enough sense of individual and collective responsibility to do for ourselves that which would be imposed upon us by a dictatorship." : "Federica Montseny",
"My ideal woman would be someone with both beauty and intelligence. Someone who can hold her own in a conversation, gets along with my family and respects elders, loves children, and have a sense of humour as whacky as mine." : "Karan Patel",
"Is E.T. out there? Well, I work at the SETI Institute. That's almost my name. SETI: Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. In other words, I look for aliens, and when I tell people that at a cocktail party, they usually look at me with a mildly incredulous look on their face. I try to keep my own face somewhat dispassionate." : "Seth Shostak",
"People are what you make them. A scornful look turns into a complete fool a man of average intelligence. A contemptuous indifference turns into an enemy a woman who, well treated, might have been an angel." : "Andre Maurois",

"Everyone I know who used to be in the intelligence community is moving into the corporate world." : "Tony Gilroy",
"During the Cold War, we gathered information by listening to the Soviets, taking pictures of the Soviets, and we allowed our human intelligence to decline." : "Bob Graham",
"The purest case of an intelligence explosion would be an Artificial Intelligence rewriting its own source code. The key idea is that if you can improve intelligence even a little, the process accelerates. It's a tipping point. Like trying to balance a pen on one end - as soon as it tilts even a little, it quickly falls the rest of the way." : "Eliezer Yudkowsky",
"I would like to take you seriously, but to do so would be an affront to your intelligence." : "George Bernard Shaw",
"It is very important that the director of the Central Intelligence Agency adhere to the same classification guidelines that all employees must adhere to because there are very good reason for those classification guidelines." : "Gina Haspel",
"A game is great, in my view, only if it can be played happily by a sane person of at least average intelligence for several hours a day for fifty years. Both pool and billiards qualify." : "Robert Byrne",
"In order to defend the Chinese race, one must first defend the Confucian culture; and in order to defend the Confucian culture, one must first defend the State. This is because what preserves the race relies upon intelligence, which is in turn nurtured by Confucian education." : "Zhang Zhidong",
"Post-human intelligence will develop hypercomputers with the processing power to simulate living things - even entire worlds. Perhaps advanced beings could use hypercomputers to surpass the best 'special effects' in movies or computer games so vastly that they could simulate a world, fully, as complex as the one we perceive ourselves to be in." : "Martin Rees",
"What matters is hard work, and emotional intelligence." : "Mickey Drexler",
"I will not, nor will I ever, publicly divulge sensitive intelligence sources and methods. For when that happens, our national security is endangered and lives can be lost." : "John O. Brennan",
"Lincoln made mistakes. Roosevelt made mistakes. Eisenhower made mistakes. The Battle of the Bulge was the biggest intelligence failure in American military history, much bigger than any in Vietnam or now. We didn't know that the Soviets were moving 400,000 or 500,000 troops. We missed it." : "Rudy Giuliani",
"The private citizen, beset by partisan appeals for the loan of his Public Opinion, will soon see, perhaps, that these appeals are not a compliment to his intelligence, but an imposition on his good nature and an insult to his sense of evidence." : "Walter Lippmann",
"Thought is more than a right - it is the very breath of man. Whoever fetters thought attacks man himself. To speak, to write, to publish, are things, so far as the right is concerned, absolutely identical. They are the ever-enlarging circles of intelligence in action; they are the sonorous waves of thought." : "Victor Hugo",
"For the several thousands of years before they became firefighters and physicians, women were sirens, enchantresses, snares. At times it seems as if female powerlessness is male self-preservation in disguise. And for millennia, this has made for a zero-sum game: A woman's intelligence was a man's deception." : "Stacy Schiff",
"The United States, like any great power, is always going to have an intelligence operation, and some electronic surveillance is obligatory in the modern world." : "Jeffrey Toobin",
"I've written a number of books that have to do with the evolution of humans, human intelligence, human emotions." : "Carl Sagan",
"The main functions of intelligence, that of inventing solutions and that of verifying them, do not necessarily involve one another. The first partakes of imagination; the second alone is properly logical." : "Jean Piaget",
"I'd rather see artificial intelligence than no intelligence." : "Michael Crichton",
"A lot of what people are calling 'artificial intelligence' is really data analytics - in other words, business as usual. If the hype leaves you asking 'What is A.I., really?,' don't worry, you're not alone." : "Om Malik",
"I don't intend to simply go away and write my plays and be a good boy. I intend to remain an independent and political intelligence in my own right." : "Harold Pinter",
"For passion, be it observed, brings insight with it; it can give a sort of intelligence to simpletons, fools, and idiots, especially during youth." : "Honore de Balzac",
"Achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050, identifying treatments to diseases like cancer, and harnessing the power of robotics and artificial intelligence to support everyday tasks are all within our grasp. The first country that gives birth to these discoveries will change life as we know it." : "Alok Sharma",
"Husbands, recognize your wife's intelligence and her ability to counsel with you as a real partner regarding family plans, family activities, and family budgeting.

"I never threatened him and no Syrian intelligence officer has ever pointed a gun to his head." : "Rafik Hariri",
"While the crash only took place six months ago, I am convinced we have now passed the worst, and with continued unity of effort, we shall rapidly recover. There is one certainty of the future of a people of the resources, intelligence and character of the people of the United States - that is, prosperity." : "Herbert Hoover",
"It is becoming harder for us to stay on top of the onslaught - e-mails, messages, appointments, alerts. Augmented intelligence offers the possibility of winnowing an increasing number of inputs and options in a way that humans can't manage without a helping hand." : "Om Malik",
"The problem of Islam as a political force is an essential one for our time and for the years to come, and we cannot approach it with a modicum of intelligence if we start out from a position of hatred." : "Michel Foucault",
"Implementation of reforms within the Police and Intelligence agencies should certainly improve security and reduce terror attacks. But that will not eliminate the problem.

"Over time I think we will probably see a closer merger of biological intelligence and digital intelligence." : "Elon Musk",

Wray",
"AI-assisted driving is a perfect platform for advancing fundamental human-centric artificial intelligence research while also producing practical applications." : "Fei-Fei Li",

"You can't come forward against the world's most powerful intelligence agencies and be completely free from risk." : "Edward Snowden",
"Emphasizing effort gives a child a variable that they can control. They come to see themselves as in control of their success. Emphasizing natural intelligence takes it out of the child's control, and it provides no good recipe for responding to a failure." : "Carol S. Dweck",
"Bill Gates wants people to think he's Edison, when he's really Rockefeller. Referring to Gates as the smartest man in America isn't right... wealth isn't the same thing as intelligence." : "Larry Ellison",
"It is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will use the highest intelligence of the army for the purposes of spying, and thereby they achieve great results." : "Sun Tzu",
"It is a curious thing: man, the centre and creator of all science, is the only object which our science has not yet succeeded in including in a homogeneous representation of the universe. We know the history of his bones, but no ordered place has yet been found in nature for his reflective intelligence." : "Pierre Teilhard de Chardin",
"Some students start thinking of their intelligence as something fixed, as carved in stone. They worry about, 'Do I have enough? Don't I have enough?'" : "Carol S. Dweck",
