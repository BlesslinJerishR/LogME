"The present is a point just passed." : "David Russell",
"Being able to express yourself under the name Erika Jayne and saying things people want to say but wouldn't, or doing things that people want to do but don't, or taking that extra leap of faith or pushing the levels of sexuality, or whatever, that helps Erika Girardi stand on her own two feet and be calm and peaceful." : "Erika Jayne",
"Theater is my temple and my religion and my act of faith. Strangers sit in a room together and believe together." : "Harvey Fierstein",
"Let us take refuge from this world. You can do this in spirit, even if you are kept here in the body. You can at the same time be here and present to the Lord. Your soul must hold fast to him, you must follow after him in your thoughts, you must tread his ways by faith, not in outward show." : "Saint Ambrose",

"What many students most want from college, although they would never admit it, is an authority structure. There is a demand for an authority which they can then reject; they want to be told what to do, so they can disobey. It is a textbook case of bad faith, a flight from freedom." : "Mark Fisher",
"Individual responsibility, hard work, paying attention in school, faith, family all these things are important." : "J. C. Watts",

That's what I see. That's the America I know!" : "Barack Obama",

"I am politically pro-choice, but personally pro-life. I have my faith but refuse to force it on the world at large - especially this world, so brutal and unjust. I cannot make these wrenching personal life and death decisions for others - nor do I believe they should be made by a church run by childless men." : "Julianna Baggott",
"The civil rights movement was based on faith. Many of us who were participants in this movement saw our involvement as an extension of our faith. We saw ourselves doing the work of the Almighty.

"Faith is what someone knows to be true, whether they believe it or not." : "Flannery O'Connor",

"Many churches of all persuasions are hiring research agencies to poll neighborhoods, asking what kind of church they prefer.

"Stupidity, outrage, vanity, cruelty, iniquity, bad faith, falsehood - we fail to see the whole array when it is facing in the same direction as we." : "Jean Rostand",
"The word 'religion' is only a label. What lies behind that, the most important thing of all, is the word 'faith'.

You're kind of in-between, or you're on the fence." : "Ridley Scott",

"Without our faith, we wouldn't have been able to succeed. On many occasions, before we'd go out on a sit-in, before we went on the freedom ride, before we marched from Selma to Montgomery, we would sing a song or say a prayer.

"How many things we held yesterday as articles of faith which today we tell as fables." : "Michel de Montaigne",

"I don't have a preferred religion - I'd have to do research. I was born a Christian, but as I've grown into my own man, I don't attach myself to a religion - 100 per cent, I have faith. Then it's locking into what suits me." : "Anthony Joshua",

"Hope, like faith, is nothing if it is not courageous; it is nothing if it is not ridiculous." : "Thornton Wilder",
"Hollywood, we get it. The Christian faith just doesn't work for you 'in the long run.'

"People look at me and see a calm, cool guy on the sidelines and I want them to know that my Christian faith affects my coaching and everything I do." : "Tony Dungy",

"Stand straight, walk proud, have a little faith." : "Garth Brooks",

Each prepared me for the next leaf on which I would land, and in this way I moved across the swamp of doubt and fear." : "Anne Lamott",
"I'm not a big fan of religion for that reason. But I am a true believer in God, and I have great faith, and I think that a spiritual connection with something is a really important part of our experience. That doesn't necessarily have anything to do with the church." : "Shaun Cassidy",

"If you look at 'The Have and the Have Nots,' I didn't want to write a show where everyone is great and wonderful and perfect. I wanted to write it so that you're not really sure who the haves are. You look at Hanna, and you see that she doesn't have much, but she has great faith." : "Tyler Perry",

"Assurance, action, and evidence influence each other in an ongoing process. This helix is like a coil, and as it spirals upward it expands and widens.

"You have to take a leap of faith before exposing yourself completely in terms of feelings and desires - especially if you're a woman." : "Mya",

"If you look at everything I do - even in 'Boo!' there's a message, and it's always 'faith, family, forgiveness.' That's the greatest gift that I've been given. I can get a message to the very people I grew up with, the millions who love what I do." : "Tyler Perry",

"Scoutcraft is a means through which the veriest hooligan can be brought to higher thought and to the elements of faith in God; and, coupled with the Scout's obligation to do a good turn every day, it gives the base of Duty to God and to Neighbour on which the parent or pastor can build with greater ease the form of belief that is desired." : "Robert Baden-Powell",
"We're big fans of the idea that faith without works is dead." : "John Tesh",

"I'm hungry for knowledge. The whole thing is to learn every day, to get brighter and brighter. That's what this world is about. You look at someone like Gandhi, and he glowed.

"Freedom isn't free. It shouldn't be a bragging point that 'Oh, I don't get involved in politics,' as if that makes someone cleaner. No, that makes you derelict of duty in a republic.

"The time to relax is when you don't have time for it." : "Sydney J. Harris",

"I would not attack the faith of a heathen without being sure I had a better one to put in its place." : "Harriet Beecher Stowe",
"My feminism is what came squarely up against my faith. There's a lot of ecstatic post-patriarchal Christians who have stuff they do with that.

"It comes with faith, for with complete faith there is no fear of what faces you in life or death." : "Jacqueline Cochran",

"I don't understand why black people have been so quiescent, so passive over the hundreds of years of American history. Why hasn't there been more violence, more armed struggle?

"In America, now, let us - Christian, Jew, Muslim, agnostic, atheist, wiccan, whatever - fight nativism with the same strength and conviction that we fight terrorism. My faith calls on its followers to love one's enemies. A tall order, that - perhaps the tallest of all." : "Jon Meacham",
"Honestly, what keeps me grounded is my faith and my value system." : "Alyson Stoner",
