"Life-writing calls for any number of dubious gifts: A touch of O.C.D., a lack of imagination, a large desk, neutrality of Swiss proportions, tactlessness, a high tolerance for archival dust.

"I don't necessarily start with the beginning of the book. I just start with the part of the story that's most vivid in my imagination and work forward and backward from there." : "Beverly Cleary",

Rather, it requires freedom and courage and the plural contributions of many different kinds of people who must maintain their individuality while giving to the group." : "Gerald Edelman",
"Nonfiction is both easier and harder to write than fiction. It's easier because the facts are already laid out before you, and there is already a narrative arc. What makes it harder is that you are not free to use your imagination and creativity to fill in any missing gaps within the story." : "Amy Bloom",
"When I was a teenager, reading for me was as normal, as unremarkable as eating or breathing.

"It's easier for a kid to have fun and have an imagination." : "Greg Cipes",

But I think there is a great difference between filling in the blanks and distorting known facts." : "Sharon Kay Penman",
"Our democracy, our constitutional framework is really a kind of software for harnessing the creativity and political imagination for all of our people. The American democratic system was an early political version of Napster." : "Al Gore",
"Charles Laughton, who's a great hero of mine, only ever made one film and it happens to be one of the great films ever, which is 'The Night of the Hunter.' It's full of his kind of imagination and creation and how you do things and just in the way he used the studio, I just thought it was a fantastical way of using the studio." : "Brian Cox",

"Laughter, and the broader category of humor, are key elements in helping us go on with our life after a loss." : "Allen Klein",
"Getting over someone is a grieving process. You mourn the loss of the relationship, and that's only expedited by 'Out of sight, out of mind.'

And if you can learn how to manage it and honour the person that you miss, you can take something that is incredibly sad and have some form of positivity." : "Terri Irwin",
"The Real is ever-present, like the screen on which the cinematographic pictures move. While the picture appears on it, the screen remains invisible.

"Moving on' is a concept invented by Housewives. Housewives who behave so appallingly all they can do is say they are moving on, preferably in a place where everyone can hear them. To stay put and acknowledge that their actions have consequences and to accept responsibility is simply too painful for this particular brand of narcissist." : "Carole Radziwill",
"I started life washing cars in Canada before moving on to selling life insurance and vacuum cleaners. Later, I went through a programme by Dr. Norman Vincent Peale, which literally changed my life. It was the turning point." : "Shiv Khera",
"I like to edit my sentences as I write them. I rearrange a sentence many times before moving on to the next one. For me, that editing process feels like a form of play, like a puzzle that needs solving, and it's one of the most satisfying parts of writing." : "Karen Thompson Walker",
"The world is a crazy, beautiful, ugly complicated place, and it keeps moving on from crisis to strangeness to beauty to weirdness to tragedy.
