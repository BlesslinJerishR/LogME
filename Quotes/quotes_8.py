"A sense of freedom is something that, happily, comes with age and life experience." : "Diane Keaton",

"The beauty of dystopia is that it lets us vicariously experience future worlds - but we still have the power to change our own." : "Ally Condie",

In a death-and-rebirth sense." : "Hozier",

"The connection to place, to the land, the wind, the sun, stars, the moon... it sounds romantic, but it's true - the visceral experience of motion, of moving through time on some amazing machine - a few cars touch on it, but not too many compared to motorcycles. I always felt that any motorcycle journey was special." : "Antoine Predock",

"Every outing is a learning experience." : "Drew Pomeranz",
"They say in the Middle East a pessimist is simply an optimist with experience." : "Ehud Barak",

"The human voice: It's the instrument we all play. It's the most powerful sound in the world, probably. It's the only one that can start a war or say 'I love you.' And yet many people have the experience that when they speak, people don't listen to them." : "Julian Treasure",

"Observation more than books and experience more than persons, are the prime educators." : "Amos Bronson Alcott",

"For more and more of us, home has really less to do with a piece of soil than, you could say, with a piece of soul. If somebody suddenly asks me, 'Where's your home?' I think about my sweetheart or my closest friends or the songs that travel with me wherever I happen to be." : "Pico Iyer",

They were very wise to allow us to film there." : "John Glen",
