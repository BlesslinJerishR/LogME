"The only thing that I've really noticed in my own experience is just people kind of saying that a woman, when they react to something exciting, 'Oh, that's a masculine way of reacting.'

"It's usually drawing on personal experience. I don't think I could dig deep enough trying to get into somebody else's life. Like 'Far From Me' - I wrote it about this waitress that I was dating when I was fifteen or so, and she broke up with me." : "John Prine",
"I sought my father in the world of the black musician, because it contained wisdom, experience, sadness and loneliness. I was not ever interested in the music of boys. From my youngest years, I was interested in the music of men." : "Eric Clapton",

"When I was a teenager, in the '80s, it was 'Dynasty.' It was 'Beverly Hills, 90210.' And those were fantasies. Those weren't reflective of my experience.

"All theory is against freedom of the will; all experience for it." : "Samuel Johnson",
"I think it's been hard for people to understand how Islam can be a good religion, and yet the Islamists are evil.

"The more you travel, the better you get at it. It sounds silly, but with experience you learn how to pack the right way.

I really had too much stuff, so I've learnt to be more economical." : "Roman Coppola",
"A good designer must rely on experience, on precise, logic thinking; and on pedantic exactness. No magic will do." : "Niklaus Wirth",

"My own experience being bullied - it made me a more compassionate person. It made me more sympathetic to the adolescent experience." : "Carolyn Mackler",
"There are pros and cons of experience. A con is that you can't look at the business with a fresh pair of eyes and as objectively as if you were a new CEO. Fire yourself on a Friday night and come in on Monday morning as if a search firm put you there as a turn-around leader. Can you be objective and make the bold change?" : "Andrea Jung",

"I have played at the Bernabeu twice with Bayern Munich, and it was a magnificent experience." : "Toni Kroos",
"I look at the NFL and see how the transition has gone at quarterback. I might be coming along at a good time.

I like to feed off the people around me." : "B. J. Daniels",

"Success needs no explanation. Failure does not have one that matters." : "Jesse Jackson",

"I have a secret project which adds four hours every day to the 24 hours we have. There's a bit of time travel involved." : "Sundar Pichai",

"Being from Miami, you're used to the fact that your home is a vacation spot. But that's what makes Miami one of the best places in the world.

"It was one of my dreams as a child, growing up in my little village with my cousins.

"I literally wear a mask. When I take it off, I'm a father. I'm a husband. I like to come home, and I like to spend time with family, and I like to travel, and I like to have a good time. And I like to be a kid every now and giggle and play with my kids." : "Rey Mysterio",

"Time travel and teleportation will have to wait. It may take centuries to master these technology.

"Those on the downside of rising economic inequality generally do not want government policies that look like handouts.

It feels like being labeled a failure." : "Robert J. Shiller",

"So while I will never minimize the costs involved in military action, I am convinced that a failure to act in Libya would have carried a far greater price for America." : "Barack Obama",

"I would have thought that I would have become one of those parents - just because it's my nature to be such a perfectionist - that anything falling short, I would have seen as a failure.

"They say there's no second act in American lives. There's something there worth exploring. Giving up an idea of yourself, examining your failure, and seeing if that failure was the system's or yours. What does it mean to not turn out to be the person you want to be?" : "Scott Rudin",
"Lincoln made mistakes. Roosevelt made mistakes. Eisenhower made mistakes. The Battle of the Bulge was the biggest intelligence failure in American military history, much bigger than any in Vietnam or now.

"I have a tendency to sabotage relationships; I have a tendency to sabotage everything. Fear of success, fear of failure, fear of being afraid. Useless, good-for-nothing thoughts." : "Michael Buble",

"Thoughtless risks are destructive, of course, but perhaps even more wasteful is thoughtless caution which prompts inaction and promotes failure to seize opportunity." : "Gary Ryan Blair",

"Overhead will eat you alive if not constantly viewed as a parasite to be exterminated. Never mind the bleating of those you employ.

"There are a lot of ways to be expressive in life, but I wasn't good at some of them. Music, for instance. I was a distinct failure with the cello. Eventually, my parents sold the cello and bought a vacuum cleaner. The sound in our home improved." : "Sam Abell",
"For diabetes in particular, we know there's a relationship between lack of glucose regulation and complications like blindness and kidney failure. So if you were diabetic and you knew that you could get your glucose in a tight, normal range just by adjusting your lifestyle, wouldn't that be great?" : "Eric Topol",
"When I was an adolescent in England, at school we had to read 'Death of a Salesman.'

"Hollywood... a city I was to come back to time and again, in sickness and in health, in success and in failure, with anticipation and with dread." : "Dirk Benedict",

We ought to recognize it and create an income-maintenance system so every single American has the dignity and the wherewithal for shelter, basic food, and medical care.

"During my sojourn in ironclad atheism, the primary arsenal leveled against Christianity had been its failure on empirical grounds. Surely, enlightened reason offered a more coherent cosmos.

"Belief in the supernatural reflects a failure of the imagination." : "Edward Abbey",
"The main failure of education is that it has not prepared people to comprehend matters concerning human destiny." : "Norman Cousins",

"I travel around the world, and there are so many beautiful girls, but that's not going to make you a supermodel. You have to have something more than just a pretty face." : "Irina Shayk",
"I myself believe that there will one day be time travel because when we find that something isn't forbidden by the over-arching laws of physics we usually eventually find a technological way of doing it." : "David Deutsch",
"The more you travel, the better you get at it. It sounds silly, but with experience you learn how to pack the right way.

"We have been fortunate enough to travel a lot and we focus heavily on melody and that really is an international language." : "James Righton",

"The amount of hassle involved in travel can be overwhelming." : "Paul Theroux",
"My goals have changed throughout my life. At one time it was winning awards, selling out concert dates, selling more albums than anyone else. Now, my goals are to see my grandchildren grown, live a long and healthy life with my family and friends and travel the world." : "Reba McEntire",

"If I were involved with the NBA, I wouldn't want a 19-year-old or a 20-year-old kid to bring into all the travel and all the problems that exist in the NBA. I would want a much more mature kid.

"Often, I'll do a quick workout in my hotel room consisting of exercises for the legs, glutes, abs, and arms with my own body weight. Also, I always have a jump rope, a medicine ball I can inflate, and a band in my suitcase. It's a great kit to have for travel." : "Izabel Goulart",

"Fitness is very important to me because it helps give me a routine when I travel. It gives me one hour of 'me' time and passes the time when I'm lonely. Living with scoliosis serves as a constant reminder to keep my core and back strong. If I get lazy, I feel it in my back first." : "Martha Hunt",
"Michael Palin decided to give up on his considerable comedy talents to make those dreadfully tedious travel shows. Have you ever tried to watch one?" : "John Cleese",

"You don't look at the big problem all together, because I think it's a little intimidating.

"Trying to change before you're ready isn't likely to be productive.

"We may not know what each day has in store for us. We could be gone tomorrow. Any minute could truly be our goodbye. But we do have this moment. This time. Today. Right now.

So I reached to the Word." : "Offset",
"We need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn't a matter of political correctness. It's a matter of understanding what makes us strong.

"You can't go forward and backwards at the same time." : "Steve Harvey",
"A lot of people think international relations is like a game of chess. But it's not a game of chess, where people sit quietly, thinking out their strategy, taking their time between moves. It's more like a game of billiards, with a bunch of balls clustered together." : "Madeleine Albright",

"At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer, if it ever reach us, it must spring up amongst us. It cannot come from abroad.

"If you want creative workers, give them enough time to play." : "John Cleese",

"It takes a long time to understand nothing." : "Edward Dahlberg",
"We act as if that being of a man or that being of a woman is actually an internal reality or something that is simply true about us, a fact about us, but actually it's a phenomenon that is being produced all the time and reproduced all the time, so to say gender is performative is to say that nobody really is a gender from the start." : "Judith Butler",
"In my mind I'm a blind man doin' time." : "Tupac Shakur",
"Last time I was in London, I visited Number 5, Bruton Street, which is the address I gave to Violet Bridgerton, the matriarch of the Bridgerton clan in my novels. It was a bit disconcerting to learn that it's actually a pub." : "Julia Quinn",

My new thought is either of these could be true, but realistically what is going to happen is when you are dead you are not going to know you are dead, so it's not the end of the world." : "Perez Hilton",

"Striving for success is healthy - but believing you need to succeed the first time around may backfire.

"You know the trait of a crocodile, don't you? It never hunts outside water. It always goes into the water to catch its prey. It never goes in the villages or in the bush looking for food. It strikes at the appropriate time. So a good guerrilla leader strikes at the appropriate time." : "Emmerson Mnangagwa",
"I'm a very positive person, but this whole concept of having to always be nice, always smiling, always happy, that's not real. It was like I was wearing a mask. I was becoming this perfectly chiselled sculpture, and that was bad. That took a long time to understand." : "Alicia Keys",

"When it's your time, it is your time." : "Bruno Mars",

"I'm not into animal rights. I'm only into animal welfare and health. I've been with the Morris Animal Foundation since the '70s. We're a health organization. We fund campaign health studies for dogs, cats, lizards and wildlife. I've worked with the L.A. Zoo for about the same length of time. I get my animal fixes!" : "Betty White",

"Now I will say this to every sinner, though he should think himself to be the worst sinner who ever lived: cry to the Lord and seek Him while He may be found. A throne of grace is a place fitted for you. By simple faith, go to your Savior, for He is the throne of grace." : "Charles Spurgeon",

So to play sports, I put it in a backpack." : "Damian Marley",
"Faith... must be enforced by reason... when faith becomes blind it dies." : "Mahatma Gandhi",
"Marxism, Freudianism, global warming. These are proof - of which history offers so many examples - that people can be suckers on a grand scale.

"I think faith is the small mustard seed of opportunities every day. For example, 'Am I going to love this person? Am I going to share my faith with this person? Am I going to pray that little prayer?' It really is a daily thing where you seize those little mustard seed opportunities and then see what God does." : "Mark Batterson",
"There are a lot of Christian fundamentalists; there are a lot of Muslim extremists. Every religion - Mormonism - has something way on the side that's completely using the religion as some weird backbone for their twisted faith. It has nothing to do with their religion." : "Patrick Wilson",

"Certain though I am - and ever more certain - that I must press on in life as though Christ awaited me at the term of the universe, at the same time I feel no special assurance of the existence of Christ. Believing is not seeing. As much as anyone, I imagine, I walk in the shadows of faith." : "Pierre Teilhard de Chardin",
"Nobody really needs a painting. It's something you kind of create value for in a way that you don't with a company. It's an act of collective faith what an object is worth.

"Your heart has to be prepared ahead of time through faith and prayer and grace and mercy and love and forgiveness so you can keep your heart open in hell, when hell happens." : "Richard Rohr",

"We need to have a modicum of faith in people's common sense, creativity and will to survive and prosper even in the face of great difficulties and obstacles.
