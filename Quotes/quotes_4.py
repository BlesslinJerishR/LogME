"Today, billions of mobile devices with extraordinary power are uniting with advancements in robotics artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, and so much more." : "Steve Mollenkopf",

"Let's say intelligence is your ability to compose poetry, symphonies, do art, math and science. Chimps can't do any of that, yet we share 99 percent DNA. Everything that we are, that distinguishes us from chimps, emerges from that one-percent difference." : "Neil deGrasse Tyson",

"Talent and intelligence never yet inoculated anyone against the caprice of the fates." : "J. K. Rowling",

"I have been honoured to serve the whales, dolphins, seals - and all the other creatures on this Earth. Their beauty, intelligence, strength, and spirit have inspired me." : "Paul Watson",
"Pro wrestling is not fake; it's sports entertainment. We go out there and we perform, and a lot of what we do out there is real, but we're not going to insult anyone's intelligence - there is a predetermined winner. It's just the fans don't know who it is, and that's what makes it so intriguing." : "Kurt Angle",

"No amount of skillful invention can replace the essential element of imagination." : "Edward Hopper",

"I have always been fascinated by paleontology and prehistoric people, and I've always thought that one of the most intriguing moments in human history was the birth of artistic imagination. I always loved those cave paintings." : "Kathryn Lasky",
"All of the Antilles, every island, is an effort of memory: every mind, every racial biography culminating in amnesia and fog. Pieces of sunlight through the fog and sudden rainbows, arcs-en-ciel. That is the effort, the labour of the Antillean imagination, rebuilding its gods from bamboo frames, phrase by phrase." : "Derek Walcott",
"Then there was Clark Ashton Smith, who wrote for Weird Tales and who had a wild imagination. He wasn't a very talented writer, but his imagination was wonderful." : "Jack Vance",

"The most important innovators often don't need any technologies - just imagination and acute sensitivity to people's needs." : "Geoff Mulgan",
"One way we can enliven the imagination is to push it toward the illogical. We're not scientists. We don't always have to make the logical, reasonable leap." : "Stella Adler",
"Gender fluidity is not really feeling like you're at one end of the spectrum or the other. For the most part, I definitely don't identify as any gender. I'm not a guy; I don't really feel like a woman, but obviously I was born one. So, I'm somewhere in the middle, which - in my perfect imagination - is like having the best of both sexes." : "Ruby Rose",
"The idea of the NHS took root in the political imagination less as an example of social entitlement's victory over private provision, and more as the embodiment of brand Britain." : "Ash Sarkar",

"Philosophy and Art both render the invisible visible by imagination." : "George Henry Lewes",
"I think artists can influence only through making music that challenges people, excites them and flips them out.

"It is above all by the imagination that we achieve perception and compassion and hope." : "Ursula K. Le Guin",
"Mystery is great, that's what art is and I think when you can leave your imagination to grow, it's good.

"The great instrument of moral good is the imagination." : "Percy Bysshe Shelley",
"But the greatest thing about music is putting it out there for people to figure out. You want the listener to find the song on their own. If you give too much away, it takes away from the imagination." : "Diana Krall",
"How can a doctor judge a woman's sanity by merely bidding her good morning and refusing to hear her pleas for release? Even the sick ones know it is useless to say anything, for the answer will be that it is their imagination." : "Nellie Bly",
"You think in a different way when you don't have any money. The joy of poverty is that you use your imagination to come up with stuff." : "Amy Sedaris",
"People are always saying it's the end of the Gutenberg era. More to the point, it's a return to an oral era. The Gutenberg galaxy was about the written word. At its best, the digital era is part of the rediscovery of the oral. At its worst, it's a Kafkaesque victory of the bureaucratic over the imagination." : "John Ralston Saul",

"Belief is nothing but a more vivid, lively, forcible, firm, steady conception of an object, than what the imagination alone is ever able to attain." : "David Hume",
"Self-reliance - that's a dirty word to Democrats. They want people to believe that self-reliance means you don't do anything with anybody. They don't want it thought of as accepting responsibility for one's life. Enterprise. Imagination. Independence. Entrepreneurism." : "Rush Limbaugh",
"It is usually the imagination that is wounded first, rather than the heart; it being much more sensitive." : "Henry David Thoreau",

"The soul that sees beauty may sometimes walk alone." : "Johann Wolfgang von Goethe",
"There is a destiny which makes us brothers; none goes his way alone. All that we send into the lives of others comes back into our own." : "Edwin Markham",
"Our uniqueness makes us special, makes perception valuable - but it can also make us lonely. This loneliness is different from being 'alone': You can be lonely even surrounded by people.

"What a child can do in cooperation today, he can do alone tomorrow." : "Lev Vygotsky",
"The people who are bullying you, they're insecure about who they are, and that's why they're bullying you. It never has to do with the person they're bullying.

"By itself, just to draw crazy creatures has limited appeal - if I had to give up one thing, it would be the wild imagination.

"The truly unique trait of 'Sapiens' is our ability to create and believe fiction. All other animals use their communication system to describe reality.

"No man should be in public office who can't make more money in private life." : "Thomas Dewey",
"Money is something that keeps you alive and healthy and just keeps you focused. It's the drive. It's the passion." : "Travis Scott",

"Fantasies are more than substitutes for unpleasant reality; they are also dress rehearsals, plans. All acts performed in the world begin in the imagination." : "Barbara Grizzuti Harrison",
"I suspect that one of capitalism's crucial assets derives from the fact that the imagination of economists, including its critics, lags well behind its own inventiveness, the arbitrariness of its undertaking and the ruthlessness of the way in which it proceeds." : "Zygmunt Bauman",
"I have always thought that the place where you sleep or the place you share with your partner should be separate from the place where you write. The domestic rituals and details somehow kill the imagination. They kill the demon in me." : "Orhan Pamuk",

"I'm just trying to write a good story, strictly from imagination. People just think it's random, they don't see the rewriting, phrasing of characters, choosing the words, bringing the world to light in which the characters live in. That creates an illusion that this is real." : "Eric Jerome Dickey",
"I feel like the Internet needs to be disarmed in some way. There needs to be a philosophical undermining of the Internet. We take it too seriously and too literally. For a reference we go to Wikipedia, which is full of inaccuracies and misinformation. It's kind of beautiful - it's all the product of imagination; it's not reality at all." : "Sufjan Stevens",
"The faking of feelings is a sin against the imagination." : "Seamus Heaney",
"For me, it's always a failure of the imagination. I have that anxiety that time is passing, that everything is ultimately fleeting and impermanent. I better take advantage of every single moment." : "Jason Silva",

"I still find it quite easy to find my way into a child's imagination. We're all Peter Pan ourselves in some respects. Everybody should keep some grip on childhood, even as a grownup." : "Tim Curry",
"What distinguishes a great artist from a weak one is first their sensibility and tenderness; second, their imagination, and third, their industry." : "Salman Rushdie",

"I can fix dishwashers. I was brought up in a castle with no money and lots of imagination. I learnt a lot about plumbing at an early age." : "Chris de Burgh",
"But I'm never gonna get to a point in my life where what it costs to shoot a movie is going to determine what it is. The limits of my imagination is the only thing that's gonna stop me." : "Abel Ferrara",

"This is one of those cases in which the imagination is baffled by the facts." : "Adam Smith",
"In film, if you've got to do a scene in a swimming pool, you do a scene in a swimming pool. If you've got to blow up a car, you blow up a car. In theater, you can't do that, and therefore, you have the opportunity to engage the audience's imagination in a way that's rich." : "John Tiffany",

"Reason respects the differences, and imagination the similitudes of things." : "Percy Bysshe Shelley",
