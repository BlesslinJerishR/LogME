"I didn't get married until I was forty because I wanted to be stable when I got married. I think I just avoided my first marriage and went right to the second. It's sort of how I see it.

People that try it walk out a believer." : "John Carmack",

"Innovation and disruption are the hallmarks of the technology world, and hardly a moment passes when we are not thinking, doing, or talking about these topics." : "Steven Sinofsky",

"I'm really hopeless with technology - I don't even have a computer." : "Ben Whishaw",

"Environmentalists should like fracking for its relative cleanliness. But they don't. They have made a bugaboo out of the chemicals in fracking fluids, which supposedly can leach into groundwater sources. I'm convinced they're dead wrong. Ultimately, good technology with a cost advantage will win out over paranoia." : "Kenneth Fisher",

Some of those fears were justified, but it didn't stop the rise of the written word. And books have proven to be incredibly useful." : "Jeremy Stoppelman",
"As big a problem as gun violence is for Chicago, it is not beyond our ability to solve. Ending this string of tragedies is our top priority as a city. We are infusing our police department with the manpower, technology and training to meet this challenge head on." : "Rahm Emanuel",

"I don't know how to construct a career that'll make me famous. Except maybe get my ears pinned back, get my teeth done, and go to America. But then I'll be competing with billions of actors who haven't got false teeth, and who are 25." : "Ian Hart",

"Famous people are deceptive. Deep down, they're just regular people. Like Larry King. We've been friends for forty years. He's one of the few guys I know who's really famous.

"I wanted to be famous and I wanted to make a fortune, and I've done that." : "Phil Hellmuth",

"To master a new technology, you have to play with it." : "Jordan Peterson",

If I go in there and fix it, it's almost like something I wrote." : "Lil Baby",
"Everything has changed in recent decades - the economy, technology, cultural attitudes, the demographics of the workforce, the role of women in society and the structure of the American family. It's about time our laws caught up. We watch 'Modern Family' on television, but we're still living by 'Leave It To Beaver' rules." : "Tom Perez",
"Communism is a monopolistic system, economically and politically. The system suppresses individual initiative, and the 21st century is all about individualism and freedom. The development of technology supported these directions." : "Lech Walesa",

"I'm a total Luddite when it comes to gadgets and technology." : "Shaun Evans",

"What really turns me on about technology is not just the ability to get more songs on MP3 players. The revolution - this revolution - is much bigger than that. I hope, I believe. What turns me on about the digital age, what excites me personally, is that you have closed the gap between dreaming and doing." : "Bono",

"Once upon a time, sound was new technology." : "Peter Jackson",
"It's easy to fall into the trap of assuming that a new technology is very similar to its predecessors.

Saylor",
"The final frontier of the digital technology is integrating into your own brain." : "Ramez Naam",

"But, I think I first got into cars because of an electric car - it was the Tesla. And then, just the fact that they are such high-tech products. There's automated driving. There's battery technology, all the other stuff that goes into it." : "Marques Brownlee",
"Washington is an incumbent protection machine. Technology is fundamentally disruptive." : "Eric Schmidt",

"As technology progresses, and as it advances, many of us assume that these advances make us more intelligent, make us smarter and more connected to the world.

"I seldom read anything that is not of a factual nature because I want to invest my time wisely in the things that will improve my life.

"I would love to do a biopic of a famous singer, like Diana Ross or Donna Summer, or an old jazz story that we haven't seen before. I would love to do that! I would love to play Diana Ross 'cause she's an icon. I'm salivating to do that." : "Taraji P. Henson",
"To be famous, in fact, one has only to kill one's landlady." : "Albert Camus",

"I'd never tried as hard with anything as I did with 'The Office,' and it was one of the things I'm proud of. I wasn't trying to be famous or a comedian, but this opportunity came along when I was 38 or 39. It came late, and I couldn't have been prouder of it." : "Ricky Gervais",

"The ladder of success is never crowded at the top." : "Napoleon Hill",
