"Computers in general, and software in particular, are much more difficult than other kinds of technology for most people to grok, and they overwhelm us with a sense of mystery." : "Om Malik",
"The way AI complements people's work, it actually creates a lot of new jobs, a lot of demand.

"First, I do not think there is any silver bullet to solving the technology side of the security equation." : "John W. Thompson",
"The thing I think is often misunderstood about Ripple is people say, 'Oh, Ripple is a centralized platform.' To me, this is a legacy perspective. Ripple's technology, IRP, is open source; XRP Ledger is open source." : "Brad Garlinghouse",
"The Arab Spring is kind of a perfect model for how people are going to use technology to act collectively in their own interest in the future. There's never been a revolution that was coordinated by social media to the degree that the Arab Spring was." : "Palmer Luckey",
"Managing players is harder these days because of the arrival of new technology. They are all using it in their spare time so they become more isolated and selfish. They share less, they talk less.

"Sampling is kind of prehistoric, given the technology and the textures you can create." : "Macklemore",

"My parents had an arranged marriage, as did so many other people when I was growing up.

"If the present Mrs. Wogan has a fault - and I must tread carefully here - if she has a fault, this gem in the diadem of womanhood is a hoarder. She never throws anything out. Which may explain the longevity of our marriage." : "Terry Wogan",
"Here's my challenge to the real men out there; it's very simple. If you have a good marriage, talk about it. If you love your wife, say it. If some moron tells you that you're merely a 'newlywed' or that you're still just 'too young to understand,' correct them." : "Steven Crowder",

"In 'Friday Night Lights,' the relationship between the coach and his wife, that marriage was something that you couldn't really understand until you actually saw it exist on film." : "Jason Katims",

"Marriage is amazing, and I wish every person on this planet to have a blissful marriage." : "Jennifer Winget",
"My grandfather used to write one sentence every day in his journal: 'I love Anne more than ever today.' I think that was his meditation - keeping him in his marriage, and also his appreciation for it. It was very touching." : "Justin Theroux",

"I just turned 40, and I look at so many performers and so many people who are actually always on time and always have an album out. They don't have actual lives, in my opinion.

They work, and they're always honing and trying to be better." : "Nolan North",

"When you look at Michael Jackson, there's nobody who loves him in that family, nobody. If they did, they'd tell him he didn't have to do all that in order to be famous.

"Celebrity culture, it's everywhere, isn't it? It's reality TV, Big Brother. I didn't become a footballer to be famous, I became a footballer to be successful. I didn't want to be famous. Now people want to be famous. Why? Why would you want people following you about all day?" : "Ryan Giggs",

"I guess a show like 'Entourage' would be wish fulfillment, right? But 'Entourage' is wish fulfillment for men. It's that you can be kind of schlumpy-looking and have access to someone famous and find yourself at a pool party surrounded by girls in bikinis." : "Jill Soloway",
"I didn't write to be famous; I wrote to keep a record." : "Gloria Emerson",

"I'm the poorest famous person in the country." : "Cenk Uygur",
"What I can't completely understand is most other people's fascination with what the famous among us do with their lips and the rest of their bodies.

"But my view is that you need a system at the border. You need some fencing but you need technology. You need boots on the ground. And then you need to have interior enforcement of our nation's immigration laws inside the country. And that means dealing with the employers who still consistently hire illegal labor." : "Janet Napolitano",
"The joke about SAP has always been, it's making '50s German manufacturing methodology, implemented in 1960s software technology, delivered to 1970-style manufacturing organizations, like, it's really - yeah, the incumbency - they are still the lingering hangover from the dot-com crash." : "Marc Andreessen",
"We underestimate our people. Given a challenge, most of our people will do it, especially the youngsters who take to technology like duck to water." : "Arundhati Bhattacharya",
"The CIA in real life, we know, is looking for new kinds of cover. It's looking for new platforms, as they like to say, and it's trying to use the revolution in communications technology, the ability to use all sorts of corporate entities in ways that are hard to detect to get our spies in the places where they need to be." : "David Ignatius",

Where there used to be work life and home life, now it's one life. And I think a lot of companies don't recognize that." : "Ivanka Trump",
